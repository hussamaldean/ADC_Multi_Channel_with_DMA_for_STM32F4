# ADC-Multi-channel-with-DMA-STM32F4
The repository demonstrates the use of multi channel single adc in STM32F4.

#ADC scan mode with DMA 

The core frequency used is 100MHz ( Max for F411RETx).

The lcd is based on ST7735 driver.

SysTick is used to generate delay in milliseconds and microsecond

The code uses direct register manipulation rather than LL or HAL
